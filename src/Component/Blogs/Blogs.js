            Q:Difference between javascript and nodejs
          </h1>
          <p>
            Ans:
            <p className="font-bold underline">JavaScript :</p>
            <p>
              Javascript is a Scripting language. Javascript is a high-level
              programming language that is used for writing scripts on the
              website. Javascript can only be run in the browsers. It is
              basically used on the client-side.
            </p>
            <p className="font-bold underline">NodeJS:</p>
            <p>
              NodeJS is a cross-platform and open source Javascript runtime
              environment that allows the javascript to be run on the
              server-side. We can run Javascript outside the browser with the
              help of NodeJS.It is mostly used on the server-side.

            Q:When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb
          </h1>
          <p>
            Ans: NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment. It's actually helps
            JavaScript to run outside of server. It's used in server side
            development. MongoDB is NoSQL database which is document oriented.
            It represents data as of JSON documents. It's used for store data.
            <p className="font-bold">
              The summary is MongoDB is a database where we can store data and
              NodeJS helps us to to connect our client site to database by it's
              server site

            Q:Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.
          </h1>
          <p>Ans:</p>
          <p className="font-bold underline">SQL</p>
          <p>
            Structured Query Language.relational database management system.
            These databases have fixed or static or predefined schema. These
            databases are not suited for hierarchical data storage. These
            databases are best suited for complex queries. Vertically Scalable.
          </p>
          <p className="font-bold underline">NoSQL</p>
          <p>
            Not only Structured Query Language.Non-relational or distributed
            database system. They have dynamic schema. These databases are best
            suited for hierarchical data storage. These databases are not so
            good for complex queries. Horizontally scalable

            Q:What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work
          </h1>
          <p>
            Ans:JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security
            information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT
            contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are
            signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims
            cannot be altered after the token is issued. <br />
            JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of
            claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties.
            What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example,
            a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for,
            or what permissions the client has been granted. A JWT is a string
            made up of three parts, separated by dots (.)

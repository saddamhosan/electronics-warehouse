            Structured Query Language.relational database management system.
            These databases have fixed or static or predefined schema. These
            databases are not suited for hierarchical data storage. These
            databases are best suited for complex queries. Vertically Scalable.

            database system. They have dynamic schema. These databases are best
            suited for hierarchical data storage. These databases are not so
